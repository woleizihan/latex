	\begin{thm}(Ray-Chaudhuri-Wilson)
		Give a subset $L$ of $s$ nonnegative integers, Let $F$ be a family of subsets of $[n]$ such that the intersection of any two members of $F$ has a cardinality contained in $L$. Then 
		\begin{equation}
			|F| \leq \sum_{i=0}^s {n \choose{i}}.
		\end{equation}
	\end{thm}
	
	\begin{prop}
		Let $k,i \in \mathbb{N}$ and $1 \leq i \leq k/2$, there exists $k$ graph property on $v$ vertices that has sensitivity $O(v^{k-i})$ and block sensitivity $\Omega (v^{k})$.
	\end{prop}
	\begin{proof}
		Define $f$ be the graph property that there exists a $K_{k+1}^{(k)}$ inside the graph such that $|K_{k+1}^{(k)} \cap E| \leq  i-1$ for any edge $E$ lies not entirely inside the clique. We claim that this is the desired $k$-graph property.\\
		\indent First we calculate the block sensitivity. Consider the empty graph, there are $v \choose{k+1}$ such cliques and for every clique chosen we eliminate any other cliques with more than $k-1$ points in common. In this way we get at least
		\begin{equation}
			\frac{{v \choose{k+1}}}{{k+1 \choose{k}}(v-k)} = c*v^{k}
		\end{equation}		 
	many cliques and any two of them have no more than $k-1$ points in common, which guarantees that they are disjoint sensitive blocks. This shows that block  sensitivity of $f$ is $\Omega(v^{k})$.\\
		\indent Then we want to show that the sensitivity of $f$ is $O(v^{k-i})$. We calculate the sensitivity by looking at $s^0(f)$ and $s^1(f)$ separately\\
		\indent When $f=1$, there is a desired $K_{k+1}^{(k)}$ clique inside the graph. To change the value of $f$, we need to either remove an edge from $K_{k+1}^{(k)}$ or add an edge with more than $i-1$ common vertices with the clique. We have
		\begin{equation}
			s^1(f) \leq {k+1 \choose{2}}+{k+1 \choose{i}}{v-i \choose{k-i}} \leq C*v^{k-i},
		\end{equation}
		for some constant $C$.\\
		\indent When $f=0$, there doesn't exist such $K_{k+1}^{(k)}$ in the graph. We call a $k+1$-tuple $\{v_1,...,v_{k+1}\}$ sensitive if adding or removing an edge from the graph will make $\{v_1,...,v_{k+1}\}$ the vertices of a desired clique. Any sensitive edge is associated with a sensitive tuple by this definition. Also, we can show that there is precisely 1 sensitive edge associated with each sensitive tuple since if there are two sensitive edges associated with a $k+1$-tuple, we can't construct a desired clique by just removing or adding just one edge. Thus we have a injection from the set of sensitive edges into the set of sensitive tuples, and let $\mathcal{F}$ denote the set of all sensitive tuples, we have
		\begin{equation}
			s^0(f) \leq |\mathcal{F}|.
		\end{equation}
		\indent Given two sensitive tuples, if they have more than $i-1$ vertices in common, without loss of generality, assume that $\{v_1,...,v_i\}$ are vertices in common. If both of them can form a desired clique by adding an edge to the graph, there are no less than 1 edge through these $i$ points and adding any edge will not remove these edges, which contradicts the fact that these two tuples can form a desired clique by adding an edge. If there exists one tuple can form a desired clique by removing an edge, there exists no less than 2 edges through $\{v_1,...,v_i\}$ in one of the tuples, and thus another tuple can't form a desired clique by either removing or adding exactly 1 edge, which contradicts the fact that the tuple is sensitive. Then given any two sensitive tuples, they have at most $k-i-1$ common vertices.\\
		\indent Then $\mathcal{F}$ is a family of subsets of $[v]$ and any of the two subsets in $F$ have at most $i-1$ intersections. By using \textbf{Theorem 0.1} with $L=\{0,1,...,i-1\}$ and $n=v$, we have
		\begin{equation}
			s^0(f) \leq |F| \leq \sum_{j=1}^{i} {v \choose{j}} \leq C^\prime * v^{i},
		\end{equation}
		for some constant $C^\prime$.\\
		\indent From above $s^0(f) = O(v^{k-i})$ and $s^1(f) = O(v^{i})$ we conclude that $s(f) = O(v^{k-i})$ since $i \leq k/2$. Hence, $f$ is a $k$-graph property with sensitivity $v^{k-i}$ and block sensitivity $v^{k}$.
	\end{proof}
	
	\begin{cor}
		When $k$ is even, there exists $k$ graph property on $v$ vertices that has sensitivity $O(v^{k/2})$ and block sensitivity $\Omega (v^k)$. When $k$ is odd, there exists $k$ graph property on $v$ vertices that has sensitivity $O(v^{(k+1)/2})$ and block sensitivity $\Omega (v^k)$.
	\end{cor}
	\begin{proof}
		When $k$ is even, choose $i=k/2$ and when $k$ is odd, choose $i=(k-1)/2$ in above proposition.
	\end{proof}
