Talk Outline

- definition of Boolean function (as either a map or a subset of Boolean cube)

- number of Boolean functions on n variables maybe

- every Boolean function can be represented as a polynomial, a decision 
tree, or a Boolean circuit

- definitions of some complexity measures on Boolean functions
- deterministic decision-tree complexity
- degree as a polynomial
- certificate complexity
- sensitivity and block sensitivity
- maybe here talk about Aaronson's two-colorings of integer lattices
- maybe CREW PRAM and/or quantum decision tree complexity

- definition of polynomial relation and some proofs on polynomial relations 
between these quantities (use the hatami-kulkarni-pankratov paper & its references)

- sensitivity conjecture and the stronger version about quadratic bound

- some examples of easy functions to get used to sensitivity and block sensitivity
like parity, majority, threshold, etc

- Rubinstein's function

- definition of graph property and cyclically invariant Boolean function 
(say that this is one nice thing about boolean functions, they are general enough 
to consider graphs)

- Sourav's function

- Turan's theorem about graph properties and sensitivity

- mention hypergraph properties to suggest a larger gap may be possible for 
hypergraphs / motivate talk

- present the isolated triangle result & proof

- present the i-isolated clique result & proof

- present other results from paper if time allows
