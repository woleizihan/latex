Talk Outline

- definition of Boolean function (as either a map or a subset of Boolean cube)

- number of Boolean functions on n variables maybe

- every Boolean function can be represented as a polynomial, a decision 
tree, or a Boolean circuit (Variation p3)

  definitions of some complexity measures on Boolean functions
- deterministic decision-tree complexity (Variation p3)
- degree as a polynomial (Variation p3)
- certificate complexity (Variation p3)
- sensitivity and block sensitivity (Variation p1-p2)
- (Communication complexity maybe?) (Variation p7-p8)
- maybe here talk about Aaronson's two-colorings of integer lattices (Variantion p19) 
	(Scott Aaronson: The sensitivity of 2-colorings of the d-dimensional interger lattice, 2010)
- maybe CREW PRAM and/or quantum decision tree complexity 
	(Scott Aaronson: Quantum certificate complexity, 2003)

- definition of polynomial relation and some proofs on polynomial relations
between these quantities (use the hatami-kulkarni-pankratov paper & its references)
	- definition (Variation p4)
	- reference for proof (Variation p4)

- sensitivity conjecture and the stronger version about quadratic bound
	- stronger version about quadratic bound (Variation p7 Question 3.7 by Turan)

- some examples of easy functions to get used to sensitivity and block sensitivity
like parity, majority, threshold, etc

- Rubinstein's function (Variation p19-p20)

- definition of graph property and cyclically invariant Boolean function 
(say that this is one nice thing about boolean functions, they are general enough 
to consider graphs)

- Sourav's function (Sourav p55)

- Turan's theorem about graph properties and sensitivity

- mention hypergraph properties to suggest a larger gap may be possible for 
hypergraphs / motivate talk

- present the isolated triangle result & proof

- present the i-isolated clique result & proof

- present other results from paper if time allows
